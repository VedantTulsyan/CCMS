Heyy There, Coder...

So, here we are getting our code to run on your PC

So that's super easy "IF YOU HEAR ME OUT" .....



STEPS :

1. So first just run "installer" batch file as aministrator (give permission if asks any)

2. Yepp ! There is no second Step

3. Just run the CCMS (.py file) and 

4. BOOM!! Done 

NOTE : PLEASE DO NOT RUN CCMS IN (PYTHON IDLE)
